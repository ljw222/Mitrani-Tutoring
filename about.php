      <p>Welcome to Mitrani Tutoring! My name is Laurie Mitrani, and I am a compassionate, child-oriented tutor who makes learning fun. I have been a certified teacher for 30+ years, and have a wide variety of teaching experience. I graduated with a Masters in Education from the University of Virginia, and have experience teaching preschool through high school age students. I have been a elementary classroom teacher, assistant principal, and a principal. In addition, I have specialized training in reading. I have been trained in the Orton-Gillingham Approach to help students with reading impairments such as dyslexia. I have also been trained in the Lindamood Bell Approach to help students with reading and comprehension.</p>
