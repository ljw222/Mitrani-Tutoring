## Contract Terms

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?
    - We will communicate with our team members about the status of our work, and whether there are any problems
    - we will all be open to constructive feedback
    - we will be responsible for the work that we are assigned, and do it before the deadlines

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
    - Do our work on time
    - Be accountable for the work that we are assigned to do
    - Respond/communicate in a timely manner

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
    - at least once a week
    - we will have a group chat

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
    - via email and in person

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
    - styling: this role will be incharge of the asthetic styling of the entire site, so that there is consistency with the stying of the entire site (if there are specific elements to each page, the person incharge of that page will be responsible for that styling).
    - each person will be assigned to their own page(s): each person will be in charge of implementing the html and php of the page that they are assigned to

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

- To hold ourselves accountable, we will each commit to a portion of the milestone. In addition to the portions we complete individually, we will collaborate on parts as a group.
- When a team member is not contributing equally, it should be brought up in the group chat or in a team meeting, and should be discussed openly.
- When not contributing equally or failing to deliver what was promised, we will say: Hey "[team member]", we talked about you completing "[portion of the project]" and it hasn't been done. When do you think you can complete this by? What support do you need to complete this part of the project?

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
    - When we disagree, we will have a conversation about the subject at hand.
    - we will be respectful of each other


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
    - if we are unable to resolve an issue, we will refer to this contract to see if the conflict violates any of the guidelines that we wrote up


10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
- We are going to have a fun time completing this website together and practicing our 2300 skills!


## How to Use This Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
