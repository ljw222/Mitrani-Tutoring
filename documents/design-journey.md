## Client Description

[Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?]

[NOTE: If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site. Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the final project requirements.]


## Meeting Notes

[By this point, you have met once with your client to discuss all their requirements. Include your notes from the meeting, an email they sent you, or whatever you used to keep track of what was discussed at the meeting. Include these artifacts here.]


## Purpose & Content

[Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.]


## Target Audience(s)

[Tell us about the potential audience for this website. How, when, and where would they interact with the website? Get as much detail as possible from the client to help you find representative users.]
  The target audience for this website are potential and existing clients of Laurie. For potential clients, this site will serve as an advertisement and endorsement to Laurie's tutoring services and qualifications. Potential clients will most likely be the parents of children that are in need of educational tutoring. Existing clients will be able to view existing and make new appointments.


## Client Requirements & Target Audiences' Needs

[Collect your client's needs and wants for the website. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Rationale** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.]

Example:
- Target Audience Need
  - **Requirement or Need** [What does your client and audience need or want?]
    - Potential clients need to what specific services are available for their children
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs or wants?]
    - Create pages for different age groups with details about the specific services offered for that age group
  - **Rationale** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
    - Rather than listing all of the services for all children preschool to high school in one place, this split will make it easier and more clear for potential clients to get a better understanding about what exactly will be offered to their child.
- Target Audience Need
  - **Requirement or Need** [What does your client and audience need or want?]
    - Potential clients need to know why they should pick Laurie as their tutor
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs or wants?]
    - Create an about page that lists Laurie's qualifications, as well as a page with testimonials from prior/existing clients
  - **Rationale** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
    - Listing Lauries qualifications, as well as adding testemonials will build up her brand, and show potential clients that they should hire her.
- Target Audience Need
  - **Requirement or Need** [What does your client and audience need or want?]
    - Existing clients need to know when they are scheduled to meet with Laurie
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs or wants?]
    - Create a page where users can sign in and view their existing appointments as well as make new ones
  - **Rationale** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
    - Creating a seperate page for users to log in will make it easy for existing clients to keep track of tutoring appointments.



## Initial Design

[Include exploratory idea sketches of your website.]


## Information Architecture, Content, and Navigation

[Lay out the plan for how you'll organize the site and which content will go where. Note any content (e.g., text, image) that you need to make/get from the client.]

[Document your process, we want to see how you came up with your content organization and website navigation.]

[Note: There is no specific amount to write here. You simply need enough content to do the job.]

Example:
- **Navigation**
  - Home
  - Portfolio
    - Websites
    - Mobile Apps
    - Tablets
  - About Me

- **Content** (List all the content corresponding to main navigation and sub-categories.)
  - *Portfolio*: list all the projects (as images) this client has worked on. When the image is hovered over, display a description of the project; add a search function to enable users search for specific projects;
  - *Websites*: showcase all the websites designed by the client, with thumbnail images and a brief description for each design;
  - *Mobile Apps*: showcase all the mobile apps designed by the client, with thumbnail images and a brief description for each design;
  - *Tablets*: showcase all the tablet applications designed by the client, with thumbnail images and a brief description for each design;

- **Process**
  - [photo of card sort]
  - [explanation of how your come up with your content organization and navigation.]


## Interactivity

[What interactive features will your site have? What PHP elements will you include?]

[Also, describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.]
1)
  We will have a page where the user can sign in, and view their existing appointments, make new appointments, as well as cancel appointments. This page will be userful to existing clients as they will have one central place to keep track of all information regarding tutoring appointments.

  To implement this page, we will have to implement the login/logout feature, by creating session cookies and a table with user ids and their corresponding hashed passwords. To make a new appointment, there will be a form that the user can fill out. When the form is submitted, we will check that that specific time is available, and then insert the new appointment information into the database. Each appointment will also have a corresponding button where the user can cancel the appointment.
2)
  On the reviews/testimonials page, we will have a feature where the user can sort the reviews. They will be able to sort by date, rating, and age group. This is important for potential clients, as they want to know whether this tutor is reputable.

  To implement this feature, we will have a drop down menu, where users can sort by specific tags.

## Work Distribution

[Describe how each of your responsibilities will be distributed among your group members.]

[Set internal deadlines. Determine your internal dependencies. Whose task needs to be completed first in order for another person's task to be relevant? Be specific in your task descriptions so that everyone knows what needs to be done and can track the progress effectively. Consider how much time will be needed to review and integrate each other's work. Most of all, make sure that tasks are balanced across the team.]

## Additional Comments

[If you feel like you haven't fully explained your design choices, or if you want to explain some other functions in your site (such as special design decisions that might not meet the final project requirements), you can use this space to justify your design choices or ask other questions about the project and process.]

## Client Feedback

[Share the feedback notes you received from your client about your initial design.]


## Iterated Design

[Improve your design based on the feedback you received from your client.]


## Evaluate your Design

[Use the GenderMag method to evaluate your wireframes.]

[Pick a persona that you believe will help you address the gender bias within your design.]

I've selected **[Abby/Patricia/Patrick/Tim]** as my persona.

I've selected my persona because... [Tell us why you picked your persona in 1-3 sentences. Your explanation should include why your persona will help you address gender-inclusiveness bugs in your design.]

### Tasks

[You will need to evaluate at least 2 tasks (known as scenarios in the GenderMag literature). List your tasks here. These tasks are the same as the task you learned in INFO/CS 1300.]

[For each task, list the ideal set of actions that you would like your users to take when working towards the task.]

Task 1: [describe your task]

  1. [action 1...]
  2. [action 2...]
  3. ...

Task 2:


### Cognitive Walkthrough

[Perform a cognitive walkthrough using the GenderMag method for all of your Tasks. Use the GenderMag template in the <documents/gendermag-template.md> file.]

#### Task 1 - Cognitive Walkthrough

[copy the GenderMag template here and conduct a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate your design (wireframes).]

[You may need to add additional subgoals and/or actions for each task.]


#### Task 2 - Cognitive Walkthrough


### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How will you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be **very** thorough and thoughtful.]


## Final Design

[Include sketches of your finalized design.]

[What changes did you make to your final design based on the results on your cognitive walkthrough?]


## Database Schema

[Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.]

Table: movies
* field 1: description...
* field...


## Database Queries

[Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]


## PHP File Structure

[List the PHP files you will have. You will probably want to do this with a bulleted list.]

* index.php - main page.
* includes/init.php - stuff that useful for every web page.
* TODO


## Pseudocode

[For each PHP file, plan out your pseudocode. You probably want a subheading for each file.]

### index.php

```
Pseudocode for index.php...

include init.php

TODO
```


## Additional Comments

[Add any additional comments you have here.]

## Issues & Challenges

[Tell us about any issues or challenges you faced while trying to complete milestone 3. Bullet points preferred.]


--- <!-- ^^^ Milestone 3; vvv FINAL SUBMISSION-->

## Final Notes to the Clients

[Include any other information that your client needs to know about your final website design. For example, what client wants or needs were unable to be realized in your final product? Why were you unable to meet those wants/needs?]


## Final Notes to the Graders

[1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.]

[2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.]

[3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.]
