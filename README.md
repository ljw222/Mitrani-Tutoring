# Mitrani Tutoring

This website was created for my final project in the course INFO 2300: Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web. The site was created in collaboration with Jamie Har and Eloise Tien. 

We worked with client Laurie Mitrani to design a site that fits the needs of her tutoring business. The website showcases a dynamic filterable testimonial page where logged in users are able to leave testimonials about Laurie's tutoring business. The site also includes a student center and admin page feature. Students are able to log in and book/view appointment details, and Laurie is able to view appointments and student details through the admin center.
